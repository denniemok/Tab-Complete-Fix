# TabCompleteFix
This simple patch attempts to address a minor tab-complete issue for ImanitySpigot2.
The bug allows the names of invisible players to be tab-completed, and that defeats the vanish system.
You may refer to [Issue #11](https://github.com/Imanity-Software/ImanitySpigot2-Issues/issues/11) for more details.
